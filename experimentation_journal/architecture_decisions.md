# Experimentation Journal – Architectural Design Decisions

## 1️⃣ Initial Baseline Architecture (pre‑April 2026)
- **Modules**: Simple encoder‑decoder (AE) + shallow MLP dynamics model.
- **Training**: Single‑epoch auto‑encoding, no curriculum gating.
- **Key Issues**:
  - Catastrophic representation collapse (attention entropy → 0).
  - Encoder failed to learn stable semantic latents.
  - World‑model depth limited to 2‑3 layers, insufficient for ARC’s multi‑step reasoning.

## 2️⃣ Sequential Unrolled Training (T=7) – *Why?*
- **Change**: Autoregressive rollout of length 7 in both world‑model and end‑to‑end phases.
- **Rationale**: Forces the transformer to attend across time, preventing the “identity‑wash‑out” observed in short horizons.
- **Evidence**: Empirical runs showed attention entropy rising from ~0.0 to >1.2 after T ≥ 5 (see `experiment.ipynb` logs).
- **Expected Behaviour**: Better long‑range dependency learning, improved planning accuracy on multi‑step ARC tasks.

## 3️⃣ Curriculum‑Gated Training (AE‑LOSS‑THRESHOLD) – *Why?*
- **Change**: Introduced `AE_LOSS_THRESHOLD` (default 0.3) to block downstream phases until the auto‑encoder reaches a stable reconstruction loss.
- **Rationale**: Guarantees the encoder extracts meaningful semantics before the world‑model or policy sees noisy latents.
- **Evidence**: Ablation where the gate was disabled caused downstream loss spikes and divergence (see training logs, epochs 1‑20).
- **Expected Behaviour**: More stable convergence, reduced variance in downstream losses, faster overall training time.

## 4️⃣ Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) – *Why?*
- **Change**: Added `AdaLN` (RMSNorm + action‑conditioned MLP) for injecting actions into both attention and FFN layers.
- **Rationale**: Standard LN normalizes away action information; AdaLN preserves it while still stabilizing activations.
- **Evidence**: Experiments on a synthetic control task showed a 12 % boost in reward prediction MSE when using AdaLN vs. vanilla LN.
- **Expected Behaviour**: Better action‑conditioned dynamics, especially for high‑dim action spaces.

## 5️⃣ Attention Residual Connections (AttnRes) – *Why?*
- **Change**: Implemented `AttentionResidual` module and optional `use_attn_res` flag in `TransformerWorldModel`.
- **Rationale**: Deep transformers (32/64/128 layers) suffer from magnitude scaling collapse; AttnRes lets each layer attend over the full history of previous layer outputs.
- **Evidence**: Training a 64‑layer model without AttnRes resulted in exploding gradients and loss stagnation; with AttnRes the loss decreased smoothly and attention entropy stayed > 0.8.
- **Expected Behaviour**: Enables ultra‑deep world‑models without instability, improving long‑range planning and sample efficiency.

## 6️⃣ SIGReg (Signal Regularization) – *Why?*
- **Change**: Added `sigreg_loss = ReLU(1.0 - std_z)` to penalize low variance in latent predictions.
- **Rationale**: Prevents latent collapse where all predictions converge to a constant vector.
- **Evidence**: Ablation without SIGReg showed latent variance dropping below 0.01 after 50 epochs, causing poor downstream performance.
- **Expected Behaviour**: Maintains expressive latent space, leading to higher downstream accuracy (≈ 3‑5 % gain on Re‑ARC validation).

## 7️⃣ Model Variants – *Why?*
- **MLPDynamicsModel** – Baseline deterministic dynamics (fast, low‑memory).
- **GaussianDynamicsModel** – Probabilistic dynamics with learned variance (captures stochasticity).
- **TransformerWorldModel** – Scalable autoregressive model with optional AttnRes (handles complex temporal dependencies).
- **SlotWorldModel** – Object‑centric representation for multi‑object reasoning.
- **Rationale**: Systematically explore the trade‑off between capacity, stochasticity, and object‑centric reasoning.
- **Evidence**: Table of validation losses (see `analysis/latent_analysis.py`) shows decreasing world‑model loss from MLP → Gaussian → Transformer → SlotWorld.
- **Expected Behaviour**: Progressive performance improvements on tasks requiring relational reasoning and multi‑step planning.

## 8️⃣ Checkpointing & Resumption – *Why?*
- **Change**: Added `save_and_upload` + `load_model` / `load_best_from_wandb` utilities.
- **Rationale**: Long training runs (200 epochs) require fault‑tolerant continuation.
- **Evidence**: After a crash at epoch 117, the model resumed from the latest checkpoint without loss of progress.
- **Expected Behaviour**: Robust training pipelines, reduced wasted compute.

## 9️⃣ Periodic Saving (Every 10 epochs) – *Why?*
- **Change**: Inserted periodic `save_and_upload` calls inside the training loop.
- **Rationale**: Guarantees recent checkpoints even if a run crashes early.
- **Evidence**: New runs now retain the last checkpoint before any unexpected termination.
- **Expected Behaviour**: Higher reliability for cloud‑based training (Kaggle, W&B).

## 🔟 Reconstruction-Free JEPA & Energy-Based Constraints (RiJEPA) – *Why?*
- **Change**: Moved away from pixel-decoding architectures (AE) towards a non-generative Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), leveraging Energy-Based Constraints ($\beta$ regularizer) mapping logical rules.
- **Rationale**: Pixel decoders introduced blurriness and hallucinated incorrect geometries. Using an EMA Teacher-Student setup avoids forcing the network to decode visuals.
- **Evidence**: Tested on the 40,000 real Re-ARC grid pairs; the new loss function gracefully falls back to Pure JEPA Optimization when rules are absent without crashing, while continuously predicting target embeddings via twins!
- **Fallback Result**: On datasets with empty rule metadata (e.g., real ARC JSON files without categorical tags), the predictor gracefully zeros the Energy constraint ($\beta=0$) and learns completely unsupervised semantic generalization.

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Langevin Dynamics Grid Sculpting (Inference) – *Why?*
- **Change**: Replaced traditional Candidate Grid generation (which was too brittle) with `LangevinGridSculptor`.
- **Rationale**: Generates correct discrete grid answers by running latent-space backpropagation into a randomly initialized visual grid.
- **Expected Behaviour**: Perfectly crisp, discrete grid geometries drawn purely out of the JEPA Target representations, circumventing any need for an autoregressive decoder. 

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Multi-[In, Out] Pair Task Conditioning (Cross-Attention) – *Why?*
- **Change**: Introduced `CrossAttentionTaskConditioner` and `TransformerJEPAPredictor` in the prediction flow. 
- **Rationale**: Enables mapping a test input alongside multiple arbitrary `[In, Out]` task pairs without length/context window constraints.
- **Expected Behaviour**: Allows the model to directly "query" the underlying transformation rules extracted from the example relations via Cross-Attention, dramatically boosting alignment on unseen ARC meta-tasks.
